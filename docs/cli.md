# batch

Outputs the input dataset as an array of arrays, each sub-array containing the specified number of records.

## Syntax

```bash
batch <batch-size> [<input-file>] [<output-file>]
```

## Inputs

Input can be 1 of the following:

- JSON file
- CSV file
- YAML file
- JSON formatted array on standard input.

## Outputs

Output can be one of the following:

- JSON file
- YAML file
- JSON formatted data on standard output.

## Arguments

- **batch-size** - Specifies the size for each batch.
- **input-file** - Can be an input file name (json, csv or yaml) or a hypen to indicate reading JSON data from standard input. Can be omitted if there are no further arguments.
- **output-file** - The name of a file (json, csv or yaml) to output the resulting dataset to. Omitting this causes JSON output to be written to standard output.



## Examples

### Reads JSON data from standard input, batches the records into groups of 5 and writes to standard output

```bash
command-that-produces-json | batch 5
```
### Reads data from a file, batches the records into groups of 5 and writes to standard output

```bash

```
### Reads data from a file, batches the records into groups of 5 and writes output to another file

```bash

```
### Reads JSON data from standard input, applies the transformation and writes output to another file

```bash

## Notes

- This command (unlike most others in Datakit) isn&#x27;t able to output directly to a file. Use redirection to write a file, shown in the example above.


## Examples

### Concatenates the data from multiple files and writes the result to standard output

```bash
concat input-file1.json input-file2.json input-file3.json
```
### Reads JSON data from standard input concatenates it with a file and writes the result to standard output

# take

Takes the first X records of the input dataset and writes them to the output dataset.

## Syntax

```bash
take <take-number> [<input-file>] [<output-file>]
```

## Inputs

Input can be 1 of the following:

```bash
command-that-produces-json | take 3
```
### Reads data from a file, takes 3 records and writes them to standard output

  - Sets the columns (and their order) that will be included in the output CSV 
  - Example: --columns=ColumnA,ColumnB,ColumnC



## Examples

### Reads JSON data from standard input and writes CSV data to standard output

```bash
command-that-produces-json | to-csv -
```
### Reads JSON data from standard input and writes a CSV data file

```bash
command-that-produces-json | to-csv output-file.csv

to-csv input-file.yaml output-file.csv
```
### Writes a CSV file setting the column names

```bash
to-csv input-file.json output-file.csv --columns ColumnA,ColumnB,ColumnC
```
# to-object

Creates a JSON object from key/value pairs extracted from the input dataset.

## Syntax

```bash
to-object <key-selector-fn> <value-selector-fn> [<input-file>] [<output-file>]
```

## Inputs

Input can be 1 of the following:

- JSON file
- CSV file
- YAML file
- JSON formatted array on standard input.

## Outputs

Output can be one of the following:

- JSON file
- YAML file
- JSON formatted data on standard output.

## Arguments

- **key-selector-fn** - A JavaScript function to select the key from each record of the input dataset. Specifying a file name will load the JavaScript code from the file.
- **value-selector-fn** - A JavaScript function to select the value from each record of the input dataset. Specifying a file name will load the JavaScript code from the file.
- **input-file** - Can be an input file name (json, csv or yaml) or a hypen to indicate reading JSON data from standard input. Can be omitted if there are no further arguments.
- **output-file** - The name of a file (json, csv or yaml) to output the resulting dataset to. Omitting this causes JSON output to be written to standard output.

## Notes

- Unlike many other datakit commands the to-object command cannot output to the CSV format.


## Examples

### Reads JSON data from standard input and writes the JSON object to standard output

```bash
command-that-produces-json | to-object "r => r.key" "r => r.value"
```
### Reads data from a file and writes the JSON object to standard output

```bash
to-object "r => r.key" "r => r.value"  input-file.csv
```
### Reads data from a file and writes the JSON object to a file

```bash
to-object "r => r.key" "r => r.value" input-file.csv output-file.json
```
### Loads JavaScript files for the key and value selector functions

```bash
to-object --file my-key-selector.js --file my-value-selector.js input-file.csv
```
### Reads JSON data from standard inputand writes the JSON object to a file

```bash
to-object "r => r.key" "r => r.value" - output-file.json
```
# to-yaml

Converts data from the JSON data format to the YAML data format.

## Syntax

```bash
to-yaml [<input-file>] [<yaml-output-file>]

- **yaml-output-file** - The name of a file (must be a YAML file) to output the resulting dataset to. Omitting this causes YAML data to be written to standard output.



## Examples

```bash
command-that-produces-json | to-yaml
```
### Reads JSON data from standard input and writes a YAML data file

# transform

Transforms an entire dataset through a user defined function.

```bash
transform <transformer-fn> [<input-file>] [<output-file>]
```

## Outputs

Output can be one of the following:

- JSON file
- CSV file
- YAML file
- JSON formatted data on standard output.

## Arguments

- **transformer-fn** - A JavaScript function to transform the input dataset. Specifying a file name will load the JavaScript code from the file.
- **input-file** - Can be an input file name (json, csv or yaml) or a hypen to indicate reading JSON data from standard input. Can be omitted if there are no further arguments.
- **output-file** - The name of a file (json, csv or yaml) to output the resulting dataset to. Omitting this causes JSON output to be written to standard output.

```bash
command-that-produces-json | transform "dataset => transform(dataset)"
```
